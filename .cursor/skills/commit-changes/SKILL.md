# Commit changes

Commit current changes with accurate titles and optional bodies. **Group by logical feature or change type** and make **one commit per group**; use a single commit only when everything clearly belongs together.

## Workflow

1. **Inspect changes**  
   Run `git status` and `git diff` (and `git diff --staged` if needed) to see all modified/added/deleted files and hunks.

2. **Group changes**  
   From the diff, identify logical groups. Examples:
   - One feature (e.g. settings API + settings page + tests) → one commit.
   - Separate features (e.g. agents page + settings page) → one commit per feature.
   - Mixed: new feature + dependency bump + docs → e.g. `feat(...)`, then `chore(deps)`, then `docs(...)`.
     Group by **purpose**, not just by file: related files that implement one change belong in one commit.

3. **For each group (in dependency order if relevant)**
   - **Stage only that group:**
     - By path: `git add <path1> <path2> ...` for the files (or directories) that belong to this commit.
     - If a file contains changes for more than one group, use `git add -p <file>` and stage only the hunks for this group.
   - **Compose the message** (see below).
   - **Commit:** `git commit -m "Title" -m "Body"` or `git commit -m "Title"` if no body.  
     Repeat until all groups are committed.

4. **Message format**
   - **Title (required):** One line, imperative, conventional-commit.  
     Format: `type(scope): short description`  
     Types: `feat`, `fix`, `chore`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `perf`, `ci`, `build`.
   - **Body (optional):** Brief summary of what and why; skip if the title is enough.

## Staging options

| Goal                           | Command                                         |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Entire files for one commit    | `git add path/to/file1 path/to/file2`           |
| Whole directory for one commit | `git add path/to/dir/`                          |
| Only some hunks in a file      | `git add -p path/to/file` (choose y/n per hunk) |
| Everything in one commit       | `git add -A` then single `git commit`           |

## Title examples

| Change              | Example title                             |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| New API route       | `feat(api): add settings GET/POST route`  |
| Bug in date display | `fix: correct timezone in report dates`   |
| Dependencies only   | `chore: update bun and lockfile`          |
| Tests for a feature | `test(agents): add page and list tests`   |
| Lint/format only    | `style: fix lint in agents page`          |
| Docs only           | `docs: update PLAN.md encryption section` |

## Rules

- **Do not** run `git push` unless the user asks to push.
- **Do not** amend, rebase, or reset; only add and commit.
- Derive messages from the actual diff; no generic or guessed messages.
- **Multiple commits by default:** one commit per logical feature/change group. Use a single commit only when all current changes clearly form one change (e.g. one small fix across two files).
- **Author:** Use only the repository’s configured Git identity (user.name / user.email). Do **not** add `Co-authored-by`, `Signed-off-by`, or any other trailer that credits Cursor or the AI. Commit with `git commit -m "..."` (and optional `-m "body"`) only; no `--author` or trailers that would add Cursor as a contributor.
